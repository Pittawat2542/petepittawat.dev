Additionally, I had the opportunity to intern at <a href='https://linecorp.com/en/' target='_blank'>LINE Company (Thailand)</a> as a software engineer, where I worked on the full-stack development of their <a href='https://shop.line.me/home/' target='_blank'>e-commerce website</a> and dealt with complex systems. Furthermore, I am honored to have been selected as part of the inaugural batch of <a href='https://developers.google.com/community/gdsc' target='_blank'>Google Developer Student Clubs</a> Leads in Thailand for my university.

            I volunteer for various occasions because I believe in paying it forward and helping others. One of my volunteering experiences includes organizing and developing web applications for Junior Programmer Camp XV, an annual camp organized by computer science students at the School of Information Technology, King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi, targeted at senior high school students throughout Thailand. In this camp, participants have the opportunity to be exposed to various activities that help them familiarize themselves with CS concepts and the university's atmosphere. I oversee the IT aspect of the camp and lead the development team. Alongside two other teammates, we developed the main website for the camp, including the registration system. Additionally, we created a camp management system to facilitate staff in the participant selection process.

            During the COVID-19 pandemic, I volunteered to help develop a web application for the university. The university needed a system to manage donated supplies that would be distributed across the country. As a lead, I directed a team of eight members to urgently develop the system, as the situation was critical. This support system not only helps the university manage the supply but also allows hospitals to request additional supplies. Throughout the period, we also provided maintenance services. The code is accessible on <a href='https://github.com/Pittawat2542/kmutt-covid-19' target='_blank'>GitHub</a>. Additionally, I currently serve as a reviewer for conferences to contribute back to the communities.

I enjoy learning and its process. The feeling of understanding something new satisfies me.

This is also a part of my personal goal revolving around <strong>life-long learning</strong>, and I believe that understanding leads to a better life and understanding of other people and things. During my time pursuing my Bachelor's degree, I also served as a tutor on various topics in computer science for my classmates to help them prepare for upcoming exams. I believe that <em>sharing knowledge not only helps other people but also helps me understand the topic better.</em>
